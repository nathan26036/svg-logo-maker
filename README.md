# SVG Logo Maker

The goal is to create a logo svg file with the users input. The user should be able to input what shape they want, what colors they want and up to 3 letters for text. Then they should be given a logo.svg file that reflects what the user wanted.

## The process

### What i did
* Created questions to gather the users input for the logo
* Created classes for each of the shapes to be tested
* Created an if that would check if the user put more than 3 letters for their text
* Created an if that checks what shape the user chose and has it add all the info for the svg file
* Created a write to file that gathers the responses and writes a logo.svg file
* Created test to make sure the shape classes were working properly
